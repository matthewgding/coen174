## Installation

To install the project, navigate to the project's GitHub repository. At the top right, click on the "<> Code" button and select one of the download options. The project will then download to your local device.

To use the website, simply open the search.html file in a web browser. This can be done by double clicking on the search.html file within the project folder, which will automatically open it in your default web browser.

To run tests, open the project in a code editor and open a new terminal. In the terminal, run "npx jest", and the test files will automatically run and display a report containing the test results. If the command fails due to permission issues with "jest", use the command "chmod 755 node_modules/.bin/jest" from the main project directory.
